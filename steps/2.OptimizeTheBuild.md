# 2. Optimize the Build

Tools for making sure the build is as small as possible and our pages as fast as possible to compile are built in to Angular CLI, all that is needed is to  make use of them.

The command to achieve the smallest possible and fastest to render build is:

```bash
ng build --aot --env=prod --prod
```

- `--prod` minify hash, and gzip.
- `--env=prod` use your prod environment constants file.
- `--aot` compile angular templates via [AOT](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html)

And to analyze our build files we can use the flag:
- `--stats-json` generate stats.json that can then be visualized in [webpack visualizer](https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/)

## So to put all this into practice let's:

- change the `package.json` to:

    ```javascript
    {
    // (...)
    "scripts": {
        // (...)
        "build": "ng build --aot --env=prod --prod --stats-json",  // change
    ```

- build with the command:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```

- And then serve it locally to ensure it worked.
    ```
    http-server dist
    ```
